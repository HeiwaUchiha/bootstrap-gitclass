# Bootstrap and Git Class

My Name is Peace Omoruyi-Osemwingie ijesurobo
This is me learning how to use git and github as well as my learnings from my bootstrap lectures from the Web Development Bootcamp at Edo Innovates

I love my experience here so far, I hope to be good enough to continue so I can finish this program and gain insight in a lot of languages yet untouched as an aspiring web developer
